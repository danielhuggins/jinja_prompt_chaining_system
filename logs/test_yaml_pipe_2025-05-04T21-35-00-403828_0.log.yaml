        \ \nAfter storms have washed away,  \nNatureâ€™s brush begins to sway.  \n\n\
        Arched like dreams in morning light,  \nCrimson, gold, and azure bright, \
        \ \nHope unfurls in wondrous sight,  \nPromises of joy take flight.  \n\n\
        Chasing clouds with laughter's gleam,  \nThey weave together every dream,\
        \  \nA fleeting glimpse, a brilliant beam,  \nIn hearts, their magic finds\
        \ a theme.  "
