      content: "In whispered winds, the leaves take flight,  \nA tapestry of gold\
        \ and red,  \nThey dance beneath the fading light,  \nAs summer's warmth begins\
        \ to shed.  \n\nEach rustling sound, a gentle sigh,  \nAs trees adorn their\
        \ autumn dress,  \nThe branches bare, the ground awry,  \nIn nature's pause,\
        \ a sweet caress.  \n\nThey swirl and twirl, a fleeting grace,  \nA carpet\
        \ soft, where footsteps roam,  \nIn every swirl, a memory's trace,  \nAs autumn\
        \ bids the world to home.  "
