      content: "In the sky, a vibrant arc does gleam,  \nColors woven from a sunlit\
        \ dream,  \nRed and gold, in harmony they play,  \nDancing softly as the clouds\
        \ drift away.  \n\nAfter rain, when the world is still,  \nNature's brush\
        \ paints the air with thrill,  \nEmerald greens and azure blues,  \nWhisper\
        \ secrets in the morning dew.  \n\nA bridge of hope, a promise so bright,\
        \  \nUniting the earth with the heavens' light,  \nIn every hue, a tale to\
        \ be spun,  \nRainbows remind us, weâ€™re never undone.  "
