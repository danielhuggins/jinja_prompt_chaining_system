# YAML Formatting Fix for Content Fields

## Summary

This PR addresses the issue with YAML formatting for content fields in logs. The main goal is to ensure all content fields use pipe style (`|`) instead of quoted style with line continuation markers.

## Changes Made

1. **Improved ContentAwareYAMLDumper**: Enhanced the custom YAML dumper to better handle content fields with pipe style formatting.

2. **Enhanced preprocess_yaml_data function**:
   - Added proper handling for all content fields
   - Added special handling for long strings to force pipe style
   - Added support for extremely long strings by inserting strategic newlines
   
3. **Consistent preprocessing**: Updated all log methods to use preprocessing before dumping to YAML
   - Updated `log_request`
   - Updated `update_response`
   - Updated `complete_response`

4. **Documentation**: Added detailed comments explaining the PyYAML limitations and workarounds

## Testing

Created a comprehensive verification test that confirms:
1. Manual YAML generation with pipe style works as expected
2. The post-processing correctly adds markdown markers to content fields
3. Identified remaining limitations with PyYAML handling of extremely long strings

## Known Limitations

There's a limitation in the PyYAML library where very long single-line strings may still use quoted style with line continuation markers even with our custom dumper. Our approach minimizes this issue by:

1. Using preprocessing to add necessary newlines to trigger pipe style
2. Adding strategic newlines in extremely long strings
3. Properly handling the post-processing of markdown markers regardless of the style

For cases where absolute consistency is required, manually formatting the YAML might still be needed, but our solution handles most common cases correctly.
