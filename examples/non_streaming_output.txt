Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems, enabling them to perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. AI encompasses various subfields, including machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics, and is increasingly integrated into everyday applications and industries.
