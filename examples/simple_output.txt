In whispered winds, the leaves take flight,  
A tapestry of gold and red,  
They dance beneath the fading light,  
As summer's warmth begins to shed.  

Each rustling sound, a gentle sigh,  
As trees adorn their autumn dress,  
The branches bare, the ground awry,  
In nature's pause, a sweet caress.  

They swirl and twirl, a fleeting grace,  
A carpet soft, where footsteps roam,  
In every swirl, a memory's trace,  
As autumn bids the world to home.
