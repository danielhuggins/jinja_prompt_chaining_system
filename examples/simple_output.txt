In whispered winds, the leaves take flight,  
A tapestry of gold and rust,  
They dance and twirl in fading light,  
A gentle waltz, as all things must.  

Crisp beneath our wandering feet,  
They paint the ground in hues so bold,  
A fleeting beauty, bittersweet,  
As summer's warmth gives way to cold.  

With every swirl, a story spun,  
Of days gone by, of time's embrace,  
In autumn's breath, we find the sun,  
And cherish each leaf's soft, fleeting grace.
