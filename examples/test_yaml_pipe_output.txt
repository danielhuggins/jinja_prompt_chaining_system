In the sky, a vibrant arc does gleam,  
Colors woven from a sunlit dream,  
Red and gold, in harmony they play,  
Dancing softly as the clouds drift away.  

After rain, when the world is still,  
Nature's brush paints the air with thrill,  
Emerald greens and azure blues,  
Whisper secrets in the morning dew.  

A bridge of hope, a promise so bright,  
Uniting the earth with the heavens' light,  
In every hue, a tale to be spun,  
Rainbows remind us, we’re never undone.
