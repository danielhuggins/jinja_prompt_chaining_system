Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics, which is the science that explains how very small particles, like atoms and photons, behave. 

In simple terms, while traditional computers use bits as the smallest unit of data (which can be either a 0 or a 1), quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits. Qubits can be both 0 and 1 at the same time, thanks to a property called superposition. This allows quantum computers to process a vast amount of information simultaneously.

Additionally, qubits can be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another, even if they are far apart. This interconnectedness can lead to faster problem-solving for
